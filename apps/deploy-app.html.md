[x] prerelease announcement


`fly deploy` continues to work to update the app:

```
fly deploy
==> Building image
Searching for image 'nginx' remotely...
image found: img_wd57v5nge95v38o0
Deploying dry-pond-1475 app with rolling strategy
  Machine 21781973f03e89 update finished: success
  Finished deploying
```

release_command, rolling and immediate strategies, and the other deploy flags and settings are supported. There are some small variations in apps v2, and weâ€™ve limited them as much as possible and updated flyctl to tell you about them.
