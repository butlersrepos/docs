[x] prerel announcement


Volumes need to be created and manually attached to machines. The `source` setting in the `[mounts]` section is no longer supported in fly.toml. There is no enforcement around volumes names.

Attach volumes with the Machines API for now. Weâ€™re working on making this easier with `fly machine update` and `fly machine clone`.

Once attached, the `destination` setting in fly.toml will be used to update the destination of the volumes. For example, the volumes will be mounted at `/my/new/directory` with this fly.toml config after running `fly deploy`:

```
[mounts]
destination = "/my/new/directory"
```
